# Loading a chart from a public helm chart repo

Prerequisite: namespace `example` contains a target with name `my-cluster`.
(Alternative: adjust the target name in the installation.)

The installation deploys a mongodb.
The deployment is **not** done with helm.
The helm chart is read from a **public helm chart repository**.
