# Import Values from the Binary Data of a ConfigMap

In this example, an installation imports values from a configmap.
Every entry of the binary data section of the configmap is bound to a separate input parameter.

The example illustrates only the import. There is nothing done with the imported values.
The installation has only a dummy inline blueprint without deploy execution.
